# Notes

Following our research group's decision to use a pie chart for a publication, I wrote a script in Python initially then followed it up with a script in R.

R issues
=========

- used ggplot
* Label assignment is a remaining issue as of 15th June 2015. Will fix it soon.

Python issues
==============

- used pandas and matplotlib for plotting
- aligned labels accordingly
- Rearranging slices to make smaller slices readable was a challenge. Fortunately, I stumbled upon an online resource to get it right: http://nxn.se/post/46440196846/making-nicer-looking-pie-charts-with-matplotlib, which essentially mixes small slices with other large slices instead of the usual sorting of slices

Alternative to pie chart
=========================

A clear alternative is a bar chart which displays the information clearly.
